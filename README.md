## Event Manager Plugin
This plugin is capable of easily managing numerous Game Events and Minigames with separate SlimeWorlds linked to them.

### Features
- Every Game Event or Minigame has its own SlimeWorld
- You can freely configure, load or unload every Event as desired
- You can start, or stop events, which players can easily join using `/event` command
- When Event is started, every player joining server will be automatically teleported to it
- Keep your server resource usage thin and don't load anything you don't need right now


### Requirements
